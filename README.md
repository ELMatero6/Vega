# Vega
Vega is a testing platform created by ELMatero6 to bring intelligent locally ran AI model's to life.



## What is this?
  I know what you're thinking, what the hell is this, and why is it such a large file.
  This is Vega, my artificial intelligence testing platform.
  it's a Mistral 7B parameter model.

  Vega is an AI model from the Doom franchise, mostly the new 2 Doom games. Currently it is only in a text based state with the AI being able to reply with vega's voice, there is no support for Speech to text yet.



## How much processing power do I need?
  As noted, this is a large scale Ai testing platform.
  So, generally that means a lot of GPU+CPU power to run it.
  However since I am a bad programmer, it works flawlessly with a low grade GPU, and I made this on a system with a GTX 1650.
  So it should run on whatever you throw at it.

  Future plans are to get it to run on a raspberry pi

# Installation



Git - https://git-scm.com/download/win


Please Go do the releases tab, then download the .zip file, Extract it, and Please note. Vega uses a lot of storage,
So ensure you have 20+ GB of storage available.

Once extracted, you can go ahead and run install-cuda.bat
This file will install all of Vega's packages and files.


# Starting Vega

Currently, the easiest way to start Vega and all of his processes is with the Start.bat file I have included with the release.
Just Double Click the file, and vega should boot up.


Happy Bug Hunting!
